## Logging

Logging is configured to output messages to both a file (`logs/app.log`) and the console. The logging format includes the timestamp, logger name, log level, and message.

## Project Files Overview

### 1. database.db

-  SQLite database file storing project-related information.

### 2. user.py

-  Python module containing classes and functions related to user management.

### 3. test.py

-  Python script for testing functionalities implemented in the project.

### 4. task.py

-  Python module containing classes and functions related to task management.

### 5. project.py

-  Python module containing classes and functions related to project management.

### 6. manager.py

-  Python module containing classes and functions related to project managers.

### 7. history.py

-  Python module containing classes and functions related to project history.

### 8. comment.py

-  Python module containing classes and functions related to comments on tasks or projects.

### 9. main.py

-  Main Python script for running the Treelomize application.

### 10. .gitignore

-  Git configuration file specifying files and directories to be ignored by version control.

### 11. requirement.txt

-  Text file listing Python dependencies required by the project.

### SQL Usage

-  The project utilizes SQL (Structured Query Language) for storing and retrieving information from the SQLite database (`database.db`). SQL queries are used within the project code to interact with the database and manage project-related data.

## Using the Manager Script

The `manager.py` script is a command-line utility designed to perform administrative tasks for the Treelomize application. It supports actions such as creating an admin user and purging all data from the database. Below are the instructions on how to use this script.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. These are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Script

To use the `manager.py` script, navigate to the directory containing the script and execute it with the appropriate arguments.

### Available Actions

The script supports the following actions:

1. **Create Admin User**
2. **Purge Data**

#### Create Admin User

To create an admin user, run the script with the `create-admin` action, providing a username and password as arguments:

```sh
python manager.py create-admin --username your_admin_username --password your_admin_password
```

This will create a new admin user in the database. If an admin user already exists, the script will log a warning and print a message indicating that the admin user already exists.

### Logging

The script logs important actions and warnings to both the console and a file named `app.log`. The log level is set to `INFO`, and the log format includes timestamps, logger name, log level, and the message.

By following these instructions, you can effectively manage administrative tasks for your Trellomize application using the `manager.py` script. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please refer to the project's documentation or contact support.
